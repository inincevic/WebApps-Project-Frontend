    <h1 class="title_text">What is Pok√©GuesserProject?</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="plain_text">PokeGuesserProject is a simple guessing game idea in which the user lists attributes of a Pokemon and the application shows which Pokemon has the attributes listed.</p>
    <p class="plain_text">Seems pretty simple, right? Why not try it?</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title_text">History and creation</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="plain_text">This idea was first created back in 2017 when a friend of mine helped me write it in C++ with simple .txt file for data. 
      That version, from now on called v1, used command line to communicate with the user.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="plain_text">In 2021 this same idea was used by a colleague and I for a project for a different subject. That version, known as v2, used Java and a simple database.
      It had a graphical user interface and a database to store data.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="plain_text">And now this version, from now onwards known as v3, will use Javascript, CSS, HTML, SQL and Python. Five programming languages of which I can call myself skilled with only SQL.
      I hope you like how it turned out!
