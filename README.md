#Description

The original idea for this project has been created by Ivan Ninčević and Anton Maurović back in 2017
That year the wrote a basic version of it in C++ using .txt files for simple comand line based guessing experience

# In 2021 and 2022 Ivan Ninčević and Matia Perčić used this idea as a project for "Računalni praktikum 2"
That version of the code was written in Java, offered a GUI and used a database to store data

# This version is being witten by Ivan Ninčević alone.
The languages used will be HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python and SQL.
HTML, Javascript and CSS will be used in the frontend trough Vue.js, while Python and it's module "Flask" will be used for backend.
SQL will also be a part of the backend, the database that I will use will be created on MongoDB.

# May 21st 2022 - first day of writing this project
This is the frontend of the project.

This fronted is being written before any form of backend has been started so some things may be changed.


The general idea is a homepage that shows the details of what is to follow and offers the user to either log in or continue as a guest.
As a guest the user can't save their correctly guessed Pokémon, share them with friends or select their favourite Pokémon.

After that the experience will branch and two different directions will be taken.
I still have to think of the details for that, but that is yet to come.

Of course there will be a special user created; Me. That user will be the only one with the ability to add Pokémon into the database.
In the worst case scenario, in which I don't pass Web Applications this year, a lot of new Pokémon will have to be added into the database.
